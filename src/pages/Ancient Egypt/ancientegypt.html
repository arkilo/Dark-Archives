<h2>The Rosetta Stone</h2>

<div class="fifth_background_comment">
<h4>The Rosetta Stone is one of the most important objects in the British Museum as it holds the key to understanding Egyptian hieroglyphs—a script made up of small pictures that was used originally in ancient Egypt for religious texts. Hieroglyphic writing died out in Egypt in the fourth century C.E.. Over time the knowledge of how to read hieroglyphs was lost, until the discovery of the Rosetta Stone in 1799 and its subsequent decipherment.</h4></div>

<div class="first_paragraph">
  <h2>• Introduction</h2>
  <h3>Ancient Egyptian rule began some 5000 years ago and the Pharaohs continued to rule up to 3000 years. The civilization began in modern day North Africa, concentrated along the rile Nile, and it thrived due to the ability of the Egyptians to adapt to conditions of the valley. They excelled at a system of controlled irrigation and predicting floods which allowed them to produce a surplus amount of crops to sustain a large population.
Coupled with the central rule and fertile lands, the river Nile gave way to an incredible Empire that would go down in history as one of the greatest ancient civilizations to ever exist.
The ancient Egyptians also excelled in fields such as quarrying, surveying and construction methods which alongside a system of mathematics allowed the creation of the monumental pyramids. </h3>

  <h2>•Heiroglphs and their origin</h2>

  <h3>Hieroglyph are made up of two Greek word meaning ‘holy’ and  ‘writing’. Hieroglyphs are an ancient Egyptian writing system, believed to be an invention of the Gods. In the native language they are known as medu netjer.
The hieroglyph script is made up of three parts:
  <h3>  • Logogram: Which represents words</h3>
  <h3>  • Phonogram: Which represents sounds</h3>
  <h3>  • Determinates: Which are added at the end of sentences to clarify their meaning.</h3>

<h3>The origin of the hieroglyphs are poorly understood, not unlike most Egyptian artifacts. The writing was seemingly done on clay tablet, which were covered with a layer of plaster which could be easily washed and replaced, hence allowing the device to be used as a convenient method of writing scripts.
The script changed from the hard to write hieroglyphs to a hieratic one, promoted almost entirely by the priests who wanted a simpler method of writing.
This progressed towards a demotic script which lacked pictorial writing almost entirely around 7th century BC.
The hieroglyphs were first deciphered by a French archaeologist, Jean Francios Champollion. He found the rosetta sculpture which contained the same decree by a Pharaoh written in Greek, Demotic and Hieroglyph. This allowed him to eventually decipher the language and he maintained that the writing was a mixture of signals representing sounds, ideas and words and lacked the common alphabets.</h3>

  <h2>• Language</h2>
<h3>The ancient Egyptian language is the oldest indigenous language and considered to be a branch of the Afro-Asiatic languages plus it is related to the Berber and other Semitic languages such as Arabic, Amharic, and Hebrew. It is one of the oldest recorded languages known alongside Sumerian. Its first known records date back to the mid-3rd millennium BC during the old kingdom of Egypt in 3400 BC, it was in use in the form of demotic and until the 17th century in the middle ages in the form of Coptic. </h3>

<div class="third_paragraph">
  <h2>• Mummification</h2>
  <h3>The practice of mummifying the dead began in ancient Egypt c. 3500 BCE. The English word mummy comes from the Latin mumia which is derived from the Persian mum meaning 'wax' and refers to an embalmed corpse which was wax-like. The idea of mummifying the dead may have been suggested by how well corpses were preserved in the arid sands of the country.

Early graves of the Badarian Period (c. 5000 BCE) contained food offerings and some grave goods, suggesting a belief in an afterlife, but the corpses were not mummified. These graves were shallow rectangles or ovals into which a corpse was placed on its left side, often in a fetal position. They were considered the final resting place for the deceased and were often, as in Mesopotamia, located in or close by a family's home.</h3>
